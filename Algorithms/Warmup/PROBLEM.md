# Algorithms / Warmup

## 1. Solve me first
Returns the sum of two integers read from stdin.

## 2. Simple Array sum
Prints the sum of the array's elements as a single integer.

## 3. Compare the Triplets
Alice and Bob each created one problem. And we have to review two problems, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 1000 which is expressed by triplets for three categories: problem claritym originality and difficulty.
We define the rating for Alice's score to be the triplets A = (a0, a1, a2). And for Bob's score to be the triplets B = (b0, b1, b2).

Our task is to score them by comparing an with bn.
- If an > bn, then Alice can get 1 point.
- If an < bn, then Bob can get 1 point.
- If an = bn, then neither get a point.

Prints each comparison points.

## 4. A Very Big Sum
Prints the sum of the arrays's ([1, 10]) elements ([0, 10^10])

## 5. Diagonal Difference
Given a square matrix of size NxN, prints the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

## 6. Plus Minus
Given an array of integers, calculate which fraction its elements are positive, which franction of its elements are negative, and which fraction of its elements are zeros, respectivily.
Print the decimal value of each faction.

## 7. Staircase
Observe that its base and height are both equal to N, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

## 8. Time Conversion
AMPM to 24 hours format. Print converted time.

## 9. Circular Array Rotation
Long description.
